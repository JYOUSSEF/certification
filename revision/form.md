What can be achieved using the **prototype_name** of the `Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\CollectionType` form type ?
> When one has a prototype embedding other prototypes, it allows to replace each one with a specific value.   
If you have several collections in your form, or worse, nested collections you may want to change the placeholder so that unrelated placeholders are not replaced with the same value.
